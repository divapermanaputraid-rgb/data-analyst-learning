## Day 5 — Metric Framing & Monetization Logic
Date: 2025-01-07

### What I studied
- Monetization logic in an ads-supported streaming model (Lite vs Premium).
- Relationship between user activity (watch hour) and business value.
- How metric choice can mislead business interpretation.

### Key understanding
- User activity (watch hour, sessions, transactions) is not equal to value unless monetization exceeds cost.
- For assessing business health, net revenue per user is more meaningful than growth or engagement metrics.
- Lite users act as the primary cost driver in an ads-supported model:
  increased watch hour directly increases infrastructure cost.
- Growth metrics can appear positive while masking declining unit economics.

### Confusions / Open questions
- At what point does increased Lite usage become structurally unprofitable even if total revenue grows?
- How to distinguish short-term monetization inefficiency from a fundamentally broken Lite model.

### Mistakes or false assumptions
- Initially treating watch hour growth as a positive signal without validating monetization efficiency.
- Underestimating how quickly cost can scale relative to ad revenue in high-usage Lite users.

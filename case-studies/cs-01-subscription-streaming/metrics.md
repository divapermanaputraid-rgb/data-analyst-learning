# Metric Framework

This document defines the metric hierarchy used in the analysis.
The goal is to clearly separate value, activity, and cost signals to avoid misleading conclusions.

## Primary Metric

### Net Revenue per Lite User

**Definition:**
Net revenue generated by a Lite user after accounting for monetization and associated costs.

**Why this metric:**
- Directly answers whether Lite user growth is economically sustainable
- Captures the balance between usage-driven cost and ad-driven monetization
- Prevents overvaluing activity without profitability

This metric represents **business value**, not engagement.

## Supporting Metrics

These metrics explain *why* the primary metric moves.

### Ad Revenue per Lite User
- Measures monetization effectiveness at the user level
- Helps identify whether revenue scales with user growth

### Ad Revenue per Watch Hour
- Indicates monetization efficiency per unit of consumption
- Useful to detect declining ad yield despite rising activity

### Watch Hour per Lite User
- Represents usage intensity
- Acts as a cost driver rather than a value metric

### Repeat Active Days
- Signals user stickiness and habit formation
- Contextual, not sufficient on its own

## Guardrail Metrics

Guardrail metrics prevent false-positive interpretations.

### Cost per Watch Hour
- Captures infrastructure and delivery cost sensitivity to usage
- Protects against “engagement-led” misinterpretation

### Total Infrastructure Cost
- Ensures aggregate cost does not scale disproportionately with activity
- Flags structural risk in Lite-heavy growth

---

## Metric Hierarchy Summary

- **Value:** Net revenue per Lite user  
- **Drivers:** Ad revenue and watch hour dynamics  
- **Constraints:** Cost per hour and total cost  

All interpretations must respect this hierarchy.

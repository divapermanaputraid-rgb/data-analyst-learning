# Case Study: Subscription Streaming — Lite vs Premium

## Context
This case study explores a streaming application with two user plans:

- **Lite**: free, ad-supported
- **Premium**: paid subscription, ad-free

Recent growth in Lite users has raised concerns about rising infrastructure costs and monetization efficiency.
This case focuses on understanding whether increased user activity translates into sustainable business value.

## Scope (Locked)
**In scope:**
- Lite vs Premium economics
- Ad revenue vs infrastructure cost
- Watch hour as a cost driver
- Net revenue per user
- Upgrade and churn signals (conceptual)

**Out of scope (for now):**
- Recommendation systems
- Content-level performance
- Marketing channel attribution
- Product or feature decisions

## Learning Goal
This case study is used as a **core learning case**, revisited and refined over time.
The objective is to practice:

- Metric framing and hierarchy
- Distinguishing activity metrics from value metrics
- Understanding unit economics in ad-supported models
- Avoiding misleading growth interpretations

## Approach
The analysis is **metric-driven**, not solution-driven.

Order of thinking:
1. Define the right primary metric
2. Break it down into supporting metrics
3. Apply guardrails to avoid false positives
4. Interpret patterns without jumping to product decisions

No product recommendations are made at this stage.

## Status
This case is intentionally **incomplete and evolving**.
Insights and assumptions will be updated as learning progresses.

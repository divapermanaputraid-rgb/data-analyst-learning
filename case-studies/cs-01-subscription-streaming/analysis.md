# Analysis — Subscription Streaming (Lite vs Premium)

## 1. Problem Framing

The business problem explored in this case is whether growth in Lite user activity
actually creates business value, or instead increases cost without improving net revenue.

The analysis intentionally focuses on Lite users because:

- Lite users do not pay subscription fees
- They are the main driver of infrastructure cost (server, bandwidth)
- Monetization relies entirely on advertising performance

In this context, activity growth (watch hour, sessions) does not automatically imply a healthy business because:

- Lite revenue does not scale linearly with activity
- Infrastructure cost tends to increase as content consumption increases

Core question:

Does higher content consumption from Lite users generate positive and scalable
net revenue per user, or does it create structural cost pressure?

---

## 2. Business Assumptions

The following assumptions are used as a starting point for reasoning:

- Lite users are the primary cost driver compared to Premium users
- Server and infrastructure cost correlates strongly with watch hour
- Ad revenue grows more slowly than watch hour
- Premium revenue is relatively stable and more predictable
- Lite user behavior varies significantly (heavy vs casual users)

Notes:

- These assumptions are not yet validated with data
- All assumptions are open to challenge during quantitative analysis

---

## 3. Metric Hierarchy

### Primary Metric

**Net revenue per Lite user**

Rationale:
- Measures the actual economic value generated by the Lite segment
- Indicates whether Lite users are sustainable from a business perspective

---

### Supporting Metrics

- Ad revenue per Lite user  
- Ad revenue per watch hour  
- Watch hour per Lite user  
- Repeat active days (as a signal of consumption intensity)

Purpose:
- To explain *why* net revenue per user increases or decreases

---

### Guardrail Metrics

- Total server cost  
- Cost per watch hour  
- Cost growth rate vs revenue growth rate  

Purpose:
- To prevent misinterpretation driven purely by activity metrics

Overall goal of this hierarchy:
To keep the analysis focused on value creation, not vanity metrics.

---

## 4. Observed Patterns (Conceptual)

Based on the business model and monetization structure, several conceptual patterns may occur:

- Watch hour per Lite user grows faster than ad revenue
- Lite DAU increases while net revenue per Lite user declines
- Heavy Lite users contribute disproportionately more cost than revenue
- Cost per hour increases as content consumption intensifies, especially during peak usage

These are conceptual diagnoses, not numerical findings.

---

## 5. Key Risks Identified

If the patterns above are true, the main risks are:

**Structural cost pressure**  
Lite user growth increases long-term cost burden

**Illusion of healthy growth**  
Activity and usage metrics rise, but business value stagnates or declines

**Monetization inefficiency**  
High content consumption is not converted into proportional revenue

These risks are structural rather than short-term operational issues.

---

## 6. Open Questions

Several key questions remain unanswered without data:

- Do heavy Lite users generate negative net revenue?
- How much cost is contributed by the top 20% of Lite users?
- Does ad revenue per hour differ across Lite user cohorts?
- Is there evidence of Lite → Premium migration over time?
- How does watch hour and revenue distribute across the long tail?

These questions guide further analysis rather than conclude it.

---

## 7. Current Confidence Level

**Relatively confident:**
- Watch hour ≠ business value
- Lite segment represents the main cost risk area
- Net revenue per user is more informative than total activity

**Still speculative:**
- The scale of imbalance between heavy and casual Lite users
- Advertising monetization efficiency per watch hour
- Long-term impact of Lite usage on Premium conversion

Status:

This analysis is currently in the problem diagnosis stage and is not decision-ready.
